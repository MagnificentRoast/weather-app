# weather-app

I present to you my weather app! It's a simple app, you just type in your city and you'll see the current weather along with your five day forecast!

## Intended use

You would see the app's homepage, type your city into the search bar, it will tell you your current weather and the forecast!

## Current state

As of this writing, I have changed the CSS to use Minty, which can be themed to your liking. I went with a minty color for this project. I have split the functions into separate files, I tried to wire it right, but to no avail. You will find the scripts in the github.
